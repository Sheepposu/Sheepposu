### Welcome to my profile

I have been programming since around 2017, and am self-taught.
My most used languages are Python and Lua. I've used a lot of Lua in making Roblox games and Python to explore various areas of programming.

I know a decent amount of css, html, Java, and little bit of Javascript.

I usually just work on whatever I feel like and I learn something new every time.

[Public projects I'm currently working on](https://github.com/stars/Sheepposu/lists/current-projects):
 - [osu.py](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py), an api wrapper for osu! api v2 made in Python.
 - [Offline chat bot](https://github.com/Sheepposu/offlinechatbot), a twitch bot that runs in the offline chat of [btmc](https://www.twitch.tv/btmc). Offline chat refers to the time when the streamer is offline.

[Past projects I'm no longer working on or finished](https://github.com/stars/Sheepposu/lists/past-projects):
 - I made [this pr](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/pull/6507) which led to [this pr](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/pull/224) by another person.
 - Made a cool [graph thingy](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu-graph) for osu!
