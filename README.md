### Welcome to my profile

I have been programming since around 2017, and am self-taught.
My most used languages are Python and Lua. I've used a lot of Lua in making Roblox games and Python to explore various areas of programming.

I know a decent amount of css, html, Java, and little bit of Javascript.

The next language I plan on/am learning is Go.

Public projects I'm currently working on: 
 - [osu.py](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py), an api wrapper for osu! api v2 made in Python.

Past projects I'm no longer working on or finished:
 - I made [this pr](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/pull/6507) which led to [this pr](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/pull/224) by another person.
